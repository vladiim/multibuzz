# Thread-Safety Bug Fix Verification

## Bug Summary

**Issue**: Middleware used instance variables (`@session_id`, `@visitor_id`, `@request`) shared across concurrent requests in multi-threaded servers (Puma). This caused race conditions where session/visitor IDs leaked between requests.

**Impact**: Pet Resorts Australia had **178,428 sessions** for only **172,000 visitors**. Some visitors had 1,500+ sessions because cookies were set with wrong session_ids under concurrent load.

**Root Cause**: Rack middleware is instantiated once and shared across all requests. Instance variables are not thread-safe.

## Verification Checklist

### After 24-48 hours (by 2025-12-25):

Run these queries in production Rails console:

```ruby
# 1. Check session creation rate AFTER fix
# Should see dramatically fewer sessions per hour
cutoff = Time.parse("2025-12-23 08:30:00 UTC")  # Adjust to actual deploy time

puts "Sessions BEFORE fix (last 24h before deploy):"
before_sessions = Session.where(created_at: (cutoff - 24.hours)..cutoff).count
puts "  Count: #{before_sessions}"

puts "\nSessions AFTER fix (24h after deploy):"
after_sessions = Session.where(created_at: cutoff..(cutoff + 24.hours)).count
puts "  Count: #{after_sessions}"

puts "\nReduction: #{((before_sessions - after_sessions).to_f / before_sessions * 100).round(1)}%"
```

```ruby
# 2. Check sessions per visitor ratio
# Should be close to 1.0-1.5 for new visitors (was 1.05 overall but outliers had 1500+)
cutoff = Time.parse("2025-12-23 08:30:00 UTC")

new_visitors = Visitor.where("created_at > ?", cutoff)
new_visitor_ids = new_visitors.pluck(:id)

sessions_for_new = Session.where(visitor_id: new_visitor_ids).count
puts "New visitors since fix: #{new_visitors.count}"
puts "Sessions for new visitors: #{sessions_for_new}"
puts "Ratio: #{(sessions_for_new.to_f / new_visitors.count).round(2)}"
```

```ruby
# 3. Check for any new outliers (visitors with 10+ sessions in 24h)
cutoff = Time.parse("2025-12-23 08:30:00 UTC")

outliers = Session.where("created_at > ?", cutoff)
  .group(:visitor_id)
  .having("count(*) > 10")
  .count

puts "Visitors with 10+ sessions since fix: #{outliers.count}"
outliers.sort_by { |_, v| -v }.first(5).each do |vid, count|
  puts "  Visitor #{vid}: #{count} sessions"
end
```

### Expected Results After Fix:

- [ ] Session creation rate drops by 90%+
- [ ] Sessions per new visitor ratio < 2.0
- [ ] No new outliers with 100+ sessions
- [ ] Cookie session_id matches env session_id (verified by tests)

## Other SDKs to Review

**CRITICAL**: Check all other SDKs for the same thread-safety bug!

### SDK Review Checklist:

| SDK | Location | Status | Reviewed By | Date |
|-----|----------|--------|-------------|------|
| mbuzz-ruby | `/Users/vlad/code/m/mbuzz-ruby` | FIXED | Claude | 2025-12-22 |
| mbuzz-python | `/Users/vlad/code/m/mbuzz-python` | SAFE | Claude | 2025-12-22 |
| mbuzz-php | `/Users/vlad/code/m/mbuzz-php` | SAFE | Claude | 2025-12-22 |
| mbuzz-node | `/Users/vlad/code/m/mbuzz-node` | SAFE | Claude | 2025-12-22 |

### Review Results:

**mbuzz-python**: SAFE
- Uses `contextvars.ContextVar` for thread-safe context storage
- Uses Flask's `g` object for request-scoped storage
- Local variables used throughout middleware
- Async session creation captures values in local variables before spawning thread

**mbuzz-php**: SAFE
- PHP is single-process per request by default
- No shared state between requests
- Each request gets fresh instance of everything

**mbuzz-node**: SAFE
- Uses `AsyncLocalStorage` from `node:async_hooks` for async request isolation
- Express middleware uses local variables (`visitor`, `session`, `secure`)
- Attaches data to request-scoped `req.mbuzz` object
- `createSessionAsync` captures values as function parameters before `setImmediate`
- Node.js is single-threaded, so race conditions are inherently less likely

### What to Look For:

1. **Middleware/Handler using instance variables or class variables for request-specific data**
   - BAD: `self.session_id = ...` or `@session_id = ...`
   - GOOD: Local variables passed through function calls

2. **Mutable shared state**
   - BAD: Global or class-level dicts/hashes storing request data
   - GOOD: Request-scoped context objects or local variables

3. **Thread-local storage without proper cleanup**
   - Check that thread-local data is cleared after each request

### Python-specific concerns:
- Check for module-level variables
- Check Flask/Django middleware for shared state
- WSGI apps can have similar issues with global state

### PHP-specific concerns:
- PHP is typically single-threaded per request, so likely SAFE
- But check for any persistent worker modes (Swoole, RoadRunner, FrankenPHP)

### Node.js-specific concerns:
- Node is single-threaded, so likely SAFE
- But check for any shared state in closures or module scope

## Data Cleanup (Optional)

After verifying the fix works, consider cleaning up the bad data:

```ruby
# Find sessions with no events (likely created by the bug)
# BE CAREFUL - only run after thorough analysis

# Count empty sessions by account
Account.find_each do |account|
  session_ids_with_events = account.events.distinct.pluck(:session_id)
  empty_sessions = account.sessions.where.not(session_id: session_ids_with_events).count
  total_sessions = account.sessions.count

  next if empty_sessions == 0

  puts "#{account.name}: #{empty_sessions}/#{total_sessions} empty sessions (#{(empty_sessions.to_f/total_sessions*100).round(1)}%)"
end
```

## Notes

- Bug was discovered via dashboard metrics investigation (avg visits showing 28.5 with 0.6 avg days)
- Traced to Pet Resorts Australia account (PetPro360)
- Logs showed session creation every few seconds with different session_ids
- Test added: `test_race_condition_with_slow_app` - 49/50 failures before fix, 0 after
